## Restaurant Page
This project is part the The Odin Project curriculum:(https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page)

## Functionality
- The user can use the tabs to navigate through the content of the page.
- The whole content of each tab is generated with vanillaJS.

## Thoughts
- This was my first go at implementing modules on different files, I really enjoy starting to work with more complex projects that require the code to be well organized.
- My first project build with webpack.

## TODO
- Styling: Just as all the projects in this JavaScript course, I will only focus on the js side of the projects, and will come back when doing the HTML/CSS course to make the UI prettier and responsive.
